# private Events

This is an Event management application where users can create events and manage them.

- Here we created the User, Event, and Attendee models and their associated controllers.
- We created a sign-up, sign in, and create event forms and we ensured the sign-in form does not require a password.
- Implemented one_to_many and many_to_many associations.
- Displayed a single event and all events on the User's show page.
- Applied #build method of the association in the #create method of events controller.
- Displayed a list of attendees on the event's show page.
- Separated upcoming events from previous events, (we also achieved this purpose using class method and scopes).
